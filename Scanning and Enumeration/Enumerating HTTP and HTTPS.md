> we can see here that `http` is running on port 80 and https on port 443 is opened, also we can see what server in which the website uses.

[+] Navigating to the website gives us this:
![default apache page](https://i.imgur.com/vI07kkU.png)

[+] We don't still have enough information, just a default page of the website, Well Mr. Heath introduced us to a tool called **`nikto`**, it comes preinstalled with Kali, which is used to scan website for vulnerabilities, just do **`nikto -h <web app>`**
```sh
