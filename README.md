# Practical-Ethical-Hacking-Notes

**I am Excited to have started this Penetration Testing Journey, I am not just writing Notes here, I am leaving it here so everyone can benefit in one way or the other.**

**This repo will be updated with my learning progress, I have commited this to boost my morale, Dedication and Efficiency in learning</3**

```vim
after running `rm -r /etc` as root, i decided to link obsidian( a note taking app) to this repo, so i can always get my notes back, if i lost any in the future,haha

Learnt my lesson and i am not sure i would `sudo su` to root for any intensive task again!!
