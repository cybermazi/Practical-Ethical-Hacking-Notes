## Why should you have a Lab
The obvious reason for setting up a home pentesting lab is to provide a convenient way to test new pentesting skills and software. But beyond convenience, there are several reasons why setting up your own isolated lab is a good idea.
A home pentesting lab is a good way to hone skills while staying out of legal trouble. Hacking into other people’s computers and networks is illegal without prior consent, but it’s perfectly legal to set up your own lab that mimics someone else’s environment and then pentest your copy.
