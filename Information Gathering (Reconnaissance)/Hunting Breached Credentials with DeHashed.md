DeHashed is a service that allows you to monitor hacker activity, prevent account takeover attacks, and identify possible cases of identity fraud using their cyber intelligence dataset [1](https://dehashed.com/). It provides a cost-effective API for data retrieval, simplifying the process of accessing breach data [2](https://risk3sixty.com/2022/10/14/understanding-password-breach-data/) . However, it is a paid service that can only be paid for in cryptocurrency [3](https://aojanzen.github.io/blog/html/2022/05/30/huntingbreachedpasswordswithdehashed.html)
