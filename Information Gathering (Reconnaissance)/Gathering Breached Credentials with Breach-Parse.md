Gathering Breached Credentials with Breach-Parse is an important step in pentesting, and TCM offers a bash script on his GitHub page that can filter a database of compromised user credentials for a specific domain name [1](https://aojanzen.github.io/blog/html/2022/05/29/gatheringbreachedcredentials.html) . This process involves searching for user names and passwords that have been exposed in data breaches [1](https://aojanzen.github.io/blog/html/2022/05/29/gatheringbreachedcredentials.html) . However, I have found no evidence regarding the specific details of how the Breach-Parse script functions or the techniques it uses.
You can find the tool and how to use it here: [Breach Parse](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse)
