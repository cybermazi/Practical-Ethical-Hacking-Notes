In Python, boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. They are typically used in conditional statements and logical operations to make decisions based on the truth or falsity of certain conditions. Relational operators are used to compare values and create boolean expressions. Here's an explanation of boolean expressions and relational operators in Python:

Relational Operators:

Python provides several relational operators to compare values. Here are the commonly used relational operators:

- Equality (`==`): Checks if two values are equal.
- Inequality (`!=`): Checks if two values are not equal.
- Greater than (`>`): Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
- Less than (`<`): Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`): Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
- Less than or equal to (`<=`): Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.

Boolean Expressions:

Boolean expressions are formed by combining relational expressions using logical operators. The logical operators in Python are:

- Logical AND (`and`): Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.
- Logical OR (`or`): Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.
- Logical NOT (`not`): Negates the value of the operand.
