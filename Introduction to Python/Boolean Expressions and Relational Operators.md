In Python, boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. They are typically used in conditional statements and logical operations to make decisions based on the truth or falsity of certain conditions. Relational operators are used to compare values and create boolean expressions. Here's an explanation of boolean expressions and relational operators in Python:

Relational Operators:

Python provides several relational operators to compare values. Here are the commonly used relational operators:

- Equality (`==`): Checks if two values are equal.
- Inequality (`!=`): Checks if two values are not equal.
- Greater than (`>`): Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
- Less than (`<`): Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`): Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
- Less than or equal to (`<=`): Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.

Boolean Expressions:

Boolean expressions are formed by combining relational expressions using logical operators. The logical operators in Python are:

- Logical AND (`and`): Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.
- Logical OR (`or`): Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.
- Logical NOT (`not`): Negates the value of the operand.

Examples:

```python
x = 5
y = 10


# Relational operators
print(x == y)   # Output: False
print(x < y)    # Output: True


# Boolean expressions
print(x < y and y > 0)    # Output: True
print(x < y or y < 0)     # Output: True
print(not (x == y))       # Output: True
```

In the example above, we have two variables `x` and `y`. We use the relational operators (`==` and `<`) to compare their values and create boolean expressions. The logical operators (`and`, `or`, and `not`) are then used to combine the relational expressions and evaluate the overall truth value.

Boolean expressions and relational operators are fundamental in controlling the flow of your program by making decisions based on conditions. They are extensively used in if statements, while loops, and other control structures to determine the execution path of your code.

Here is how it was used in the video:

```python
#Boolean expressions (True or False)
print("Boolean expressions:")

bool1 = True
bool2 = 3*3 == 9
bool3 = False
bool4 = 3*3 != 9

print(bool1,bool2,bool3,bool4)
print(type(bool1))

bool5 = "True"
print(type(bool5))

#Relational and Boolean operators
greater_than = 7 > 5
less_than = 5 < 7
greater_than_equal_to = 7 >=7
less_than_equal_to = 7 <= 7

test_and = True and True #True
test_and2 = True and False #False
test_or = True or True #True
test_or2 = True or False #True

test_not = not True #False
```
