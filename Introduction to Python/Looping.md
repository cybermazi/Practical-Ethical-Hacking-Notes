In Python, looping allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times. It is a fundamental concept used for iterating over data structures, performing repetitive tasks, and controlling the flow of your program. There are two main types of loops in Python: `for` loops and `while` loops. Here's an explanation of looping in Python:

1. for Loop:
2. The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or any iterable object. It executes a block of code a fixed number of times, based on the elements or items in the sequence. Here's the general syntax:
```
for item in sequence:
    # code to be executed for each item in the sequence
```

Example:
```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

In this example, the `for` loop iterates over each item in the `fruits` list, and the block of code inside the loop (`print(fruit)`) is executed for each item. It will output:
```
apple
banana
orange
```

1. while Loop:
2. The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true. It continues looping until the condition becomes false. Here's the general syntax:
```
while condition:
    # code to be executed while the condition is true
```

Example:

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

In this example, the `while` loop will continue executing the code inside the loop (`print(count)`) as long as the condition `count < 5` is true. It will output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

The `break` and `continue` Statements:

Within loops, you can use the `break` statement to exit the loop prematurely and the `continue` statement to skip the current iteration and move to the next one.

Looping provides a powerful mechanism for iterating over data, performing calculations, and controlling program flow. By using loops effectively, you can automate repetitive tasks and process large amounts of data efficiently.

How it was used in the tutorial
```python
#For loops - start to finish of an iterate
vegetables = ["cucumber", "spinach", "cabbage"]
for x in vegetables:
	print(x)
	
#While loops - execute as long as true
i = 1

while i < 10:
	print(i)
	i += 1
```
