In Python, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions allow you to organize code into logical and modular units, making your code more readable, maintainable, and reusable. Here's an explanation of functions in Python:

Function Definition:

A function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses, and a colon. The function may also have parameters (optional) and a return statement (optional) to send back a result. Here's an example of a simple function definition:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

Function Call:

To execute a function, you need to call it by its name, followed by parentheses. Here's an example of calling the `greet()` function:
```python
greet()
```
